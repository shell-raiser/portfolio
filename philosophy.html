    <h1 style="text-align: center;">This <em> Design</em> is crap</h1>
    <h2> Why is this site so simple ? </h2>
    I've started to appreciate minimalism, removing what is not needed.
    No matter how well I design the site, the content is what matters. And flashy design just obscures the truth - mediocre content, which in portfolio sites translate to terrible hello world projects & meaningless achievements. <br>
    So this is just a step in progressing towards doing meaningful things.

    <h2>What happend to the old site ?</h2>
    Only for homies who remember it, its been archived <a href="/archive.html" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"> here </a>
    <br><br>
    <h2>But what about <em>Dark Mode </em> </h2>
    If you're that paranoid you already have <a href="https://darkreader.org/"> Dark Reader</a> installed, its great on these plain HTML sites.
